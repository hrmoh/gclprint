Gas Counters Barcode Label Printing Utility

This is the source code for a utility application I had developed around 2006 (along with its software protection key generator, as it was developed with commercial intentions) which was used to generate 2D barcode labels for identifying Gas customers. It was specifically optimized to utilize ZPL printing language used by Zebra barcode printers.

The source code was compiled against Visual C++ 6.0, and it uses ADO to connect to its Microsoft access database.
